        <p>
            Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century.
            <br>
            He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship,
            and
            <br>
            became Ciri's adoptive father. <br>

            During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers
            <br>
            their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his
            hair
            <br>
            white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers. <br>

            Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his
            <br>
            mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of
            <br>
            appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for
            <br>
            themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde",
            but
            <br>
            this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his
            <br>
            chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a
            Rivian
            <br>
            accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for
            the
            <br>
            Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him.[1] He, therefore,
            <br>
            became a true knight.
